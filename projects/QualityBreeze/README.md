# TotallyTubular

This is a sudoku solver, written in python.

Uses some stupid features because they sounded fun. Notably Maybe monads for all the grid spaces.

TODO:
    - Iterative solver
    - Removing hints as it progresses
        - Rather than recalculating all hints every step
    - Work one space at a time, rather than being in a giant loop
    - solve( ) instead of step( )
