    Recursive octree rasterizer, with a sick blender shader

IntensePuppet
    String art creator
    Draws a random path around the control points

IvoryNeutron
    Voronoi generator using kd-trees
    Stupidly inefficient
    Sure, we can run a kd-lookup for every pixel, why not? x)

java

LateMorning
    Basic perlin noise viewer
    Used it to get a sense of scale when using Processing's noise()

Mercury
    My little Processing library
    Has a random wrapper that adds some utility I use consistently
    Has support for custom random distributions
    Has my pride and joy, a sand painter that takes a distribution, and drops grains of sand

RoughDonut
    A mimic-ing of SandStroke
    Drawing waves with a constant density in the x axis
    Later incorporated into Mercury

RustyNeptune

    This gets really unsettling very quickly

SadJazz
    Circle movement sand painter
    Uses some fun color palette manipulation

SandyFist
    BitterFist with sandpainting...
    Not sure why this was a separate project

SatanistSwan
    Plotter inspired line flow field multicolored generator
    Intersects lines with grid squares, overlaying several colors
