Projects:

AlarmistRainbow
    Triangle subdivision sand painter

BitterFist
    Shepherding random grids
    Uses factories for the grid coordinates and the color ranges

BrownWaterbird
    Random line drawer

BurningSun - WIP
    Dyson swarm simulator

DiscardedEyelid
    Circular, additive, sin wave viewer

ElasticRoadRunner
    A bokeh-like starfield creator
    Uses a perlin field as a probability distribution
    Does some other funky stuff with probability distributions as well

Engine
    Full graphics engine based on glfw and OpenGL
    Has simple geometry support

EternalRailroad
    An attempt to elicit 3d perception by constraining a grid's random walking to an "up" axis

Fractal
    A modular fractal viewer in OpenGL

FreakyTuna
    Black hole simulator!

FrozenAvenue
    K-Means image segmentation

HeavyOyster - WIP
    Idea for a generative behavior system that both responds to its environment and behaves in a locally optimal way

IntensePuppet
    String art creator
    Draws a random path around the control points

IvoryNeutron
    Voronoi generator using kd-trees
    Stupidly inefficient
    Sure, we can run a kd-lookup for every pixel, why not? x)

LateMorning
    Basic perlin noise viewer
    Used it to get a sense of scale when using Processing's noise()

Mercury
    My little Procssing library
    Has a random wrapper that adds some utility I use consistently
    Has support for custom random distributions
    Has my pride and joy, a sand painter that takes a distribution, and drops grains of sand

QualityBreeze
    Python Sudoku solver

RestlessTiger - WIP, really neat
    Idea for a self modifying system that could be initialized with a vibrating table

RoughDonut
    A mimic-ing of SandStroke
    Drawing waves with a constant density in the x axis
    Later incorporated into Mercury

SadJazz
    Circle movement sand painter
    Uses some fun color palette manipulation

SlidingLlama - WIP
    Water drop on voronoi diagram
    Uses spring forces to simulate the effect of a waterdrop

SquareVulture
    Agglomerative clustering
    Originally used to clean up datasets for StrawLobster

StrawLobster
    DTFE drawer for a delaunay triangulation

TimelyVenus - WIP
    A line segment density drawer

TombstoneTriangulator
    CGAL Delaunay triangulation as a service
    Takes a json of points, returns a json of points, edges, and faces

TotallyTubular
    Python processing script
    A hyphae grower, currently still broken
    Will lag out your computer if you try to run it
    Really disturbing to watch actually...

TurkeyNeck - WIP
    Guitar neck scale and chord builder

VitalVegetable
    Perlin viewer using shortlifespan random walkers

WesternPython
    Swinging arms with a sandpainter

YellowSummer
    Genetic algorithm
    Tries to find x colors such that the differences between all mixtures of colors is maximized
    Is actually pretty cool
