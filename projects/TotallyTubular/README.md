# TotallyTubular

A py.processing project to simulate hyphae growth. This is a stepping stone to further dynamic surface growth simulations. Really I just want to make something freaky that grows on its own.

The genVid script uses ffmpeg and libx264 to convert the frames this project generates into a video file. A playlist of the various generations of the script can be seen on my youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAhjX8qHjfZU2ve5y5VrsboXlJT0soamS

I was inspired to make this by Inconvergent, whose content I absolutely love. Find the inspiration for this and waaaay more at his site: http://inconvergent.net/generative/hyphae/
