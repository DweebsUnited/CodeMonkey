# Engine

A fully working rendering engine, with extendable classes for cameras, shaders, shapes, etc.

**REQUIRES**: GLFW3, GLM, OpenGL 4.1, GLEW

Currently, this only has a makefile for Mac OSX, if you'd like to port it to linux, please do. Otherwise be patient, and I may eventually do it for you. No promises.

## Usage

Build the project, it will put a static library in the CodeMonkey build directory. You *should* be able to link just the library. If it doesn't work, figure out the graphics link flags from the makefile.

## Contributing
