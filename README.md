# CodeMonkey

A repository of Generative Artwork projects I have made.

## Projects

###### AimlessFlannel
VPlotter controller and precision evaluator

###### AlarmistRainbow
Triangle subdivision sand painter

###### AppropriatePineapple
Multiple rotating arms with sand painting :o

TODO: smooth the sand painting, the base arm is too separated at current step size

###### BitterFist
Shepherding random grids

Uses factories for the grid coordinates and the color ranges

###### BlueBoxer
Shader based frosted glass rain droplets

As the rain runs down the glass, it reveals starry night underneath

###### BlueSubdivision
Random tower generator in python

###### BrownWaterbird
Random line drawer

###### BurningSun - WIP
Dyson swarm simulator

###### CheerfulTea
Canny edge detection test, converted from a really old gist

###### DigitalScissors
Sweeping sand painter

###### DiscardedEyelid
Circular, additive, sin wave viewer

###### DustyFirecracker
Raytracing engine

###### EarlyCanal - WIP
Attempt to make random projections by placing axis randomly in the viewport

###### EasternPlanet
Dice battle simulator in python

###### ElasticRoadRunner
A bokeh-like starfield creator

Uses a perlin field as a probability distribution

Does some other funky stuff with probability distributions as well

###### ElectricAlien
Fuzzy line triangle filler

###### EternalRailroad
An attempt to elicit 3d perception by constraining a grid's random walking to an "up" axis

###### Fractal
A modular fractal viewer in OpenGL

###### FreakyTuna
Black hole simulator!

###### FrozenAvenue
K-Means image segmentation

###### HeavyOyster - WIP
Idea for a generative behavior system that both responds to its environment and behaves in a locally optimal way

###### HotPlutonium
Runner for TombstoneTriangulator, customized for Aksinia's project

###### HuskyKangaroo
Recursive octree rasterizer, with a sick blender shader

###### IntensePuppet
String art creator

Draws a random path around the control points

###### IvoryNeutron
Voronoi generator using kd-trees

Stupidly inefficient

Sure, we can run a kd-lookup for every pixel, why not? x)

###### java
    Soon to be Eclipse project with all my projects nestled inside

    A way to reduce the amount of duplicate code

    Projects for now include:

    DangerousTire
        Light painting base that outputs 3d printer gcode

    TitaniumSheepdog
        Simulation of sunlight hitting bathroom tile

###### LateMorning
Basic perlin noise viewer

Used it to get a sense of scale when using Processing's noise()

###### Mercury
My little Processing library

Has a random wrapper that adds some utility I use consistently

Has support for custom random distributions

Has my pride and joy, a sand painter that takes a distribution, and drops grains of sand

###### NorthernmostTiger
Voronoi crystal rasterizer

Unfortunately I have lost the blender project for this one

###### OliveSummer
Flow field simulations

###### QualityBreeze
Python Sudoku solver

###### RestlessTiger - WIP
Idea for a self modifying system that could be initialized with a vibrating table

###### RichVenom
Random actors on an expanding circle

###### RoughDonut
A mimic-ing of SandStroke

Drawing waves with a constant density in the x axis

Parts later incorporated into Mercury

###### RustyNeptune
RGB rock-paper-scissors

This gets really unsettling very quickly

###### SadJazz
Circle movement sand painter

Uses some fun color palette manipulation

###### SandyFist
BitterFist with sandpainting...

Not sure why this was a separate project

###### SatanistSwan
Plotter inspired line flow field multicolored generator

Intersects lines with grid squares, overlaying several colors

###### SlidingLlama - WIP
Water drop on voronoi diagram

Uses spring forces to simulate the effect of a waterdrop

###### SquareVulture
Agglomerative clustering

Originally used to clean up datasets for StrawLobster

###### SteamyToupee
Fascinating artifacts caused by sampling noise()

###### StrawLobster
DTFE drawer for a delaunay triangulation

###### TemporarySubdivision
Simple midpoint displacement mountain range

###### TimelyVenus - WIP
A line segment density drawer

###### TombstoneTriangulator
CGAL Delaunay triangulation as a service

Takes a json of points, returns a json of points, edges, and faces

###### ToPeeCAAAW
Squares drawn with increasing entropy in random sampling

###### TotallyTubular
Python processing script

A hyphae grower, currently still broken

Will lag out your computer if you try to run it

Really disturbing to watch...

###### TurkeyNeck - WIP
Guitar neck scale and chord builder

###### VitalVegetable
Perlin viewer using short lifespan random walkers

###### WesternPython
Swinging arms with a sandpainter

###### YellowSummer
Genetic algorithm

Tries to find x colors such that the differences between all mixtures of colors is maximized

## History

This was started when I was rooting around and found hundreds of old one-off scripts from when I was learning to program, and realized I never bothered to write reusable code. For a while I built algorithmic explorations into it, but as my interests moved away from the academic, and towards artwork, it was converted. This now houses all my experiments with Processing, the programmatic art tool.
