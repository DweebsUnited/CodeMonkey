# CodeMonkey

A repository of Generative Artwork projects I have made.

## History

This was started when I was rooting around and found hundreds of old one-off scripts from when I was learning to program, and realized I never bothered to write reusable code. For a while I built algorithmic explorations into it, but as my interests moved away from the academic, and towards artwork, it was converted. This now houses all my experiments with Processing, the programmatic art tool.
