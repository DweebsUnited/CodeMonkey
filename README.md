# CodeMonkey

A repository of useful libraries I never want to rewrite. Includes projects on different topics I have learned in my academic explorations, as well as many one time use scripts.

Has full (okay not quite) Doxygen support, and a config file. Has several other major projects incorporated in as well. Those are listed below.

## Highlights

* Data structure implementations from simple to templated behemoths.
  * Everything I learned in CS 251: Data Structures and Algorithms
* Major projects will show up here as they are completed.
* In fieri:
  * Signal processing: FFT, DSP, reading answer messages off an iClickr
  * Rendering projects such as fractals, terrain generation
  * Fixed point math (because I learn best by implementation)
  * A complete rendering engine:
    * Basic shape library with file loading.
    * Extendable parts, from camera controls to shaders.
    * Will incorporate graphic optimizations as I take the time to learn them.
  * RocketShip: Genetic generation of github user icons
  * Lindon: Genetic approximation of images using colored lines

## Installation

Download it. If using visual studio, adding all the .h's to "Header Files", and all the .cpp's to "Source Files" seems to work. You can mess around in main if you just want to play with library structures. If you want to run a project, add its files instead of the library files. Good luck.

## Usage

For now, you're on your own to figure out dependencies. Build what files need to be built, link what needs linking. There are makefiles for the library and for each project, which are a good starting point if you want to use it for something.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Do work on a feature branch off master
3. Push it somewhere
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

This was started when I was rooting around and found hundreds of old one-off scripts from when I was learning to program, and realized I never bothered to write reusable code. I'm now taking the time to build new projects in a very reusable way: as a library. From now on as I come across new algorithms I want to try implementing, or have new project ideas, they just get added to this. If something doesn't work, or I give up, I'll comment out functionality but leave the structure and documentation, in case I ever want to revisit it.

Rock climbing, Gaellic hurling, my hobbies are best described as eccentric. My foremost passion though is coding. I hope you get some good use out of this.
