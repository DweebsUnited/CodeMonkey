# CodeMonkey

A repository of useful libraries I never want to rewrite. Includes projects on different topics I have learned in my academic explorations, as well as many one time use scripts.

Has full (okay not quite) Doxygen support, and a config file. Has several other major projects incorporated in as well. Those are listed below.

## Highlights

* Data structure implementations from simple to templated behemoths.
  * Everything I learned in CS 251: Data Structures and Algorithms
* A full rendering engine:
  * Basic shape library with file loading.
  * Extendable parts, from camera controls to shaders.
  * Incorporates graphics optimizations as I take the time to learn them.
* Major projects will show up here as they are completed.
* In fieri:
  * Signal processing: FFT, DSP, reading answer messages off an iClickr
  * Rendering projects such as fractals, terrain generation, 
  * Fixed point math (because I learn best by implementation)

## Installation

Download it. Anything past that is in the air for now. I use visual studio, and just add all the .h's to "Header Files", and all the .cpp's to "Source Files". Then you can use main to start your own project, or include one of the projects and call it's run function. I'll see about making a library module -> files needed chart when I start using CLI again next school year.

## Usage

For now, you're on your own. Build what files need to be built, link what needs linking. 

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

This was started when I was rooting around and found hundreds of old one-off scripts from when I was learning to program, and realized I never bothered to write reusable code. I'm now taking the time to build new projects in a very reusable way: as a library. As I come across new algorithms I want to try implementing, or have new project ideas, they just get added to this from now on. If something doesn't work, or I give up, I'll comment out functionality but leave the structure and documentation.

My name is Eric S. Osburn, my handle is DweebsUnited, and my nickname is Ozzy. I'm a CS undergrad at Purdue, who doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. Rock climbing, Gaellic hurling, my hobbies are best described as eccentric. My foremost passion though is coding. I hope you get some good use out of this.
